# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM and News Sentiment  

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model combined with news sentiment analysis. By integrating historical Bitcoin price data with news article information, the model can capture market trends and fluctuations to provide more accurate predictions.

## Introduction  

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that has attracted significant interest from investors and researchers. However, its price is highly volatile, making prediction challenging. This project utilizes an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network, to predict Bitcoin prices. Additionally, sentiment analysis from news articles is incorporated to improve prediction accuracy.  

## Dataset  

The project utilizes the following data sources:  

- **Bitcoin Price Data**: Collected from a reliable data source, including open price, close price, high price, low price, and trading volume in 12-hour timeframes.  
- **News Data**: Articles related to Bitcoin are gathered from various sources, providing insights into events and trends that may impact Bitcoin's price.  

## Preprocessing  

The preprocessing steps include:  

- **Price Data Processing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating relevant features for the model.  
- **News Data Processing**: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to convert text into numerical features, such as word vectorization or embedding models.  
- **Data Merging**: Combining price and news data based on timestamps to form the final dataset for model training.  

## Model Development  

The model is built through the following steps:  

1. **Model Architecture**: An LSTM model with hidden layers to capture temporal relationships in price and news data.  
2. **Model Training**: Using preprocessed data to train the model, with mean squared error as the loss function and Adam optimizer.  
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM layers, neurons, learning rate, and batch size to optimize performance.  

## Model Evaluation  

The model is evaluated using:  

- **Test Data**: A portion of data not used in training to assess prediction accuracy.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure model performance.  
- **Comparison with Other Models**: Benchmarking against alternative prediction models like ARIMA or linear regression to assess the effectiveness of integrating news data.  

## Conclusion  

This project demonstrates that combining LSTM with news sentiment analysis can enhance Bitcoin price prediction accuracy. However, due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, achieving precise predictions remains challenging and requires further research.
